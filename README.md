## *NEW* Level Editor & Community Levels! 
The Piggle level editor is now live with a complete community level system!

4. Browse and play other people's levels in a beautiful grid layout!

## Recent Improvements
- **Unified Game Engine**: All levels (adventure mode and user-created) now use the same game engine for consistent gameplay

## How to play

## The tech stack
The frontend is done using the ReactJS framework styled with CSS. For the backend, 
user authentication and data management (email, username, and high scores) 
are handled using Firebase, with user information stored in Google Firestore via the Firebase SDK.

*My first attempt at making a game in React JS, pretty fun stuff!*

## How to play
- Aim with your mouse and click to shoot the ball
- Hit all of the red pegs to win!
- Every peg hit scores 100 points
- The more pegs you hit with a single ball, the more score you'll get
- Try to get the highest score possible!

*My first attempt at making a game in React JS, pretty fun stuff!*

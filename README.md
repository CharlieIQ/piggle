# Piggle
Piggle is a game where you try to hit pegs with pigs shot from a cannon. 

[Play Piggle!](https://charlieiq.github.io/piggle/)

## How to play
- Aim with your mouse and click to shoot the ball
- Hit all of the red pegs to win!
- Every peg hit scores 100 points
- The more pegs you hit with a single ball, the more score you'll get
- Try to get the highest score possible!

## The tech stack
The frontend is done using the ReactJS framework styled with CSS. For the backend, 
user authentication and data management (email, username, and high scores) 
are handled using Firebase, with user information stored in Google Firestore via the Firebase SDK.

*My first attempt at making a game in React JS, pretty fun stuff!*
